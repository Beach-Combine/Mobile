- Currently, this service is providing beta service for Busan, Korea

### Tip
Our service is currently focused on Busan, South Korea. Therefore, we provide a testing feature for customers in inland areas or those who cannot visit Busan to experience the entire cleaning process.

Upon entering the home screen, users will see a `Test` button. When they press this button, their current location will be moved to the Busan area, allowing them to explore various features. If users move to a different location from their current position, the screen will reflect the corresponding change. Feel free to click on nearby markers to experience different feedback.

Please note that this feature is designed solely for testing purposes and is not reflected in the actual database. Therefore, no rewards will be given upon completing the entire cleaning process. Keep this in mind!

In the actual Busan sea, all features can be used without any issues. Come and enjoy Busan!

## üìã GIT Strategy

### 1) Git Workflow

### main ‚Üí develop ‚Üí feature/Issue#-feature, fix/Issue#-feature, refactor/Issue#-feature

1. Work individually on each branch `local - feature/Issue#-feature`
2. After completing the task, submit a PR to `remote - develop`.
3. After code review, receive approval and merge
4. Every time a merge occurs in `remote - develop`, all team members pull from `remote - develop` to maintain the latest status

### 2) Commit Convention
